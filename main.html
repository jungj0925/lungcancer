				<h1>Respiratory System</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>As every living organism requires gas exchange to operate, as the mitochondria in the cells of the organism needs oxygen to create energy, called cellular respiration. The gas obtained from the lungs diffuses through The transfer of gas of terrestrial animals such as humans occurs through three phases: breathing, transport of gases, and gaseous exchange. Also, most terrestrial organisms have lungs which are the main respiratory organ, and are lined up with epithelial tissues covered in cilia, producing mucus to moisturize the respiratory surface. The respiratory surface requires to be wet with a large surface area, and allows diffusion to happen. </p>

				<p>The air gets inhaled into the lungs when the diaphragm contracts, decreasing the pressure. The air enters the lungs as it travels from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. Air enters through the pharynx, trachea and bronchi, where it finally enters the alveoli. As the alveoli has a strange shape, it increases the surface area of the air that can diffuse to the capillaries on the alveoli. This oxygenated blood gets delivered throughout the body by the circulatory system. </p>

				<h1>What is Lung Cancer?</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Lung cancer is a most common type of cancer - an uncontrolled growth of cells which causes tumours - that starts in the lungs. The tumours restrict the transportations of gases from the lungs to the bloods, where they are sent to the various parts of the body. </p>
				<img src="lung2.png">
				<p> There are two types of lung cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Small cell lung cancer (SCLC). </p>
				<h2>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</h2>
				<p>This type of lung cancer takes up about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers, and consists of subtypes, which are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (cancer.org). They are identified by the different cells found in the cancer, looked under the microscope. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Adenocarcinoma</strong>, taking up 40% of NSCLC, forms on the outer edges of the lungs and under the bronchi which creates mucus. This occurs mostly to younger males then other types of lung cancer. Also, Adenocarcinoma can be found on the exterior of the lungs which would be easily found and removed. A type of Adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma in situ, usually has a lower fatality rate than other types of lung cancers. <br><br><u>Symptoms</u> -  chronic cough, coughing out mucus and blood, difficulty of breathing, and chest pain (my.clevelandclinic.org)</li> <br>
					<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong> forms in flat and scale-like cells called the squamous cell of the airway, and is caused mostly by smoking (occurs to 98% of smokers). There are 4 main types of squamous cells in a lung, which are papillary, small cell, clear cell, and basaloid. <br><br> <u>Symptoms</u> - Reoccuring chest pains, breath shortness, sore throat, pain in arm, and constant fever (beaumont.org)</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="squamous.png">
				<p class="caption">Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, pathologyoutlines.com</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Large cell carcinoma (LCLC)</strong>, taking about 10% of NSCLC, usually forms on the exterior of the lung, and tends to spread faster than other types of lung cancer. They are also extremely hard to treat. The name comes from its big size in comparison to other cancer cells, and is vital as the LCLC can be easily mistaken for other less serious symptoms, such as common cold (verywellhealth.com). <br><br> <u>Symptoms</u> - fatigue, mild dyspnea, and achiness in the back</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h2>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)</h2>
				<p>Sometimes called oat cell cancer, these types of cancer take up about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. Similar to the Large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC), the SCLC also spreads incredibly fast, where according to cancer.org, 70% with SCLC would have the cancer cell already spreading to parts of their body. SCLC has an incredibly high chance of the cancer cells returning. </p>

				<h1>Main Causes & Symptoms</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Many people get diagnosed with lung cancer mostly due to smoking and secondhand smoking, which causes about 90% of all lung cancer cases (lung.org). The risk of getting lung cancer substantially decreases and a person quits smoking, or even limits the amount of cigarettes they smoke. Other causes of lung cancer, although somewhat rare, are being exposed to radiation (x rays) multiple times, exposure to Radon or Uranium, and could be caused by genetics, where it’s been passed down by a family member. The genetics will be breifly described below.</p>
				<h2>How?</h2>
				<p>Lung cancer shares all the properties of any other cancers, which are mainly caused by mutation of DNA of a cell. These mutations are occured in a both extrinsic and intrinsic ways. Extrinsic means that source from outside of the body alters with the genomic sequence, and intrinsic is where factors such as genetics causes a replication error.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Extrinsic</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Extrinsic factors consist of X-rays, UV lights, chemicals (benzene), and radioactive elements (Radon). The damages done by external factors could be fixed by a repair mechanism of a DNA. However, if the repair doesn’t happen, apoptosis, or programmed death of a cell, occurs. Sometimes the apoptosis also doesn’t work, creating enough mutation to create a cancer cell. The process repeats and duplicates to form a tumour on a body.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

					<p class="caption">Thymine Dimer, theconversation.com</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Intrinsic</strong>
						<br>
						<p>Intrinsic factors are replication error of genes inherited from a family member. A certain change in DNA (alternations in chromosome 6) could change the possibility of a person getting lung cancer. Also, certain people inherit a better ability to break down cancer-causing chemicals from a cigarette. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Symptoms</h2>
				<p>On top of cell-specific symptoms mentioned above, there are a few more common symptoms of lung cancer, which are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hoarseness</li>
					<li>A lingering or worsening cough</li>
					<li>Weakness and fatigue</li>
					<li>Loss of appetite and weight loss</li>
					<li>High blood pressure</li>
					<li>Coughing up phlegm (mucus) or blood</li>
					<li>Vomiting</li>
					<li>Muscle weakness</li>
					<li>Coma</li>

				<h1>Diagnosis & Treatments</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
				<p>Lung cancer are usually diagnosed by taking tests. These are the possible ways to diagnose cancer of an patient: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>CT scans</strong> scan the patient's body, creating a visual of the inside. Dye may be injected into the patients' body to get a clearer view of the veins and the organs.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Physical exams</strong> are tests that checks general health of a patient. During the physical exam, the doctor will check for any possible disease that might by in the patient's body.</li><br>
					<li><strong>Sputum cytology</strong> is where a pathologist checks sputum from a patient and views it through a microscope, looking for possible cancer cells. </li> <br>
					<li><strong>Labratory tests</strong> are procedures where the doctor looks through a sample of patient's urine, blood, or tissues to diagnose a disease.</li>
				</ul> <hr>
				<h2>Treatments</h2>
				<p>Although the best treatment for lung cancer would be to prevent it - not smoking, there are still treatments for lung cancers. Possible treatments for non-small cell lung cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy (cdc.gov). If a person has Small cell lung cancer, the doctors will run tests to find if the patient has genetic mutation due to the cancer cells, and treat them accordingly. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Surgery</strong> is where the operator physically cuts out the cancer cells or tissue that had been damaged. </li> <br>
					<li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> means getting rid of the cancer cells using chemicals and drugs,which can be in the form of pills or injection.</li> <br>
					<li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> uses x-rays and high-energy rays to kill the cancer (cdc.gov).</li> <br>
					<li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong> is similar to chemotherapy, but instead of killing the cancer cells with drugs, targeted therapy is used to stop the spread of cancer cells with drugs. </li>
				</ul>
