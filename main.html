				<h1>What is Lung Cancer?</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Lung cancer is a most common type of cancer - an uncontrolled growth of cells which causes tumours - that starts in the lungs. The tumours restrict the transportations of gases from the lungs to the bloods, where they are sent to the various parts of the body. </p>
				<img src="lung2.png">
				<p> There are two types of lung cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Small cell lung cancer (SCLC). </p>
				<h2>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</h2>
				<p>This type of lung cancer takes up about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers, and consists of subtypes, which are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (cancer.org). They are identified by the different cells found in the cancer, looked under the microscope. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Adenocarcinoma</strong>, taking up 40% of NSCLC, forms on the outer edges of the lungs and under the bronchi which creates mucus. This occurs mostly to younger males then other types of lung cancer. Also, Adenocarcinoma can be found on the exterior of the lungs which would be easily found and removed. A type of Adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma in situ, usually has a lower fatality rate than other types of lung cancers. <br><br><u>Symptoms</u> -  chronic cough, coughing out mucus and blood, difficulty of breathing, and chest pain (my.clevelandclinic.org)</li> <br>
					<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong> forms in flat and scale-like cells called the squamous cell of the airway, and is caused mostly by smoking (occurs to 98% of smokers). There are 4 main types of squamous cells in a lung, which are papillary, small cell, clear cell, and basaloid. <br><br> <u>Symptoms</u> - Reoccuring chest pains, breath shortness, sore throat, pain in arm, and constant fever (beaumont.org)</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="caption">Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, pathologyoutlines.com</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Large cell carcinoma (LCLC)</strong>, taking about 10% of NSCLC, usually forms on the exterior of the lung, and tends to spread faster than other types of lung cancer. They are also extremely hard to treat. The name comes from its big size in comparison to other cancer cells, and is vital as the LCLC can be easily mistaken for other less serious symptoms, such as common cold (verywellhealth.com). <br><br> <u>Symptoms</u> - fatigue, mild dyspnea, and achiness in the back</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h2>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)</h2>
				<p>Sometimes called oat cell cancer, these types of cancer take up about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. Similar to the Large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC), the SCLC also spreads incredibly fast, where according to cancer.org, 70% with SCLC would have the cancer cell already spreading to parts of their body. SCLC has an incredibly high chance of the cancer cells returning. </p>

				<h1>Main Causes & Symptoms</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Many people get diagnosed with lung cancer mostly due to smoking and secondhand smoking, which causes about 90% of all lung cancer cases (lung.org). The risk of getting lung cancer substantially decreases and a person quits smoking, or even limits the amount of cigarettes they smoke. Other causes of lung cancer, although somewhat rare, are being exposed to radiation (x rays) multiple times, exposure to Radon or Uranium, and could be caused by genetics, where it’s been passed down by a family member. The genetics will be breifly described in the <a href="#4">Genetics</a> section</p>
				<h2>Symptoms</h2>
				<p>On top of cell-specific symptoms mentioned above, there are a few more common symptoms of lung cancer, which are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hoarseness</li>
					<li>A lingering or worsening cough</li>
					<li>Weakness and fatigue</li>
					<li>Loss of appetite and weight loss</li>
					<li>High blood pressure</li>
					<li>Coughing up phlegm (mucus) or blood</li>
					<li>Vomiting</li>
					<li>Muscle weakness</li>
					<li>Coma</li>
				</ul>
