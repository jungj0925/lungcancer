				<h1>What is Lung Cancer?</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Lung cancer is a most common type of cancer - an uncontrolled growth of cells which causes tumours - that starts in the lungs. This could happen mostly due to smoking and secondhand smoking, which causes about 90% of all lung cancer cases (lung.org). Other causes could be due to radioactive gas/chemicals like radon, uranium, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel and some petroleum products that had entered the body through the respiratory system. The tumours restrict the transportations of gases from the lungs to the bloods, where they are sent to the various parts of the body.</p>
				<img src="lung2.png">
				<p> There are two types of lung cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Small cell lung cancer (SCLC). </p>
				<h2>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</h2>
				<p>This type of lung cancer takes up about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers, and consists of subtypes, which are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (cancer.org). They are identified by the different cells found in the cancer, looked under the microscope. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Adenocarcinoma</strong>, taking up 40% of NSCLC, forms in the alveoli which creates mucus. Symptoms of adenocarcinoma include chronic cough, coughing out mucus and blood, difficulty of breathing, and chest pain (my.clevelandclinic.org).</li>

				<h2>1. Self-Driving (Autonomous) Capabilities</h2>
				<p>Self driving cars have been a hot topic amongst both tech lovers 
				and car enthusiasts with a lot of startups and companies jumping into
				this field. Google started off the self-driving projects back in 2009
				which could navigate through California's busy streets without human
				interface. By using ML, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and databases 
				collected by several companies, we could train the autonomous cars
				and teach them, using algorithms, what real-life driving looks like. </p>
				<p>The GIF on the left is what Tesla sees when it is self-driving.
				The algorithms identify various elements of the surrounding environment
				, including cars, road lanes, road signs, and data of the car. In
				order for a machine to "see", they need to follow the 2 steps needed: 
				image classifications and image localization. Image classification 
				classifies what the machine is looking at, and image localization is 
				finding where the image is located. Using Convolutional Neural Network
				(CNN), the machine learns and identifies the object using the databases
				collected. The CNN basically scans the image, and whenever it detects 
				something that's known, it returns "True", and otherwise, "False".</p>
				<p>
					The autonomous technology is fast-growing, with competitors like Tesla and GM developing the technology for the best self-driving cars. 
				</p>
				<h2>2. Data Science for Stock Market</h2>
				<p>With many individuals jumping into stocks/cryptos, data science has greatly contributed in predicting and analyzing trends of the stock market. The first time Big Data was used for the stock market was when a company named RS Metrics started to create algorithms that looked at various different oil tanks, and could figure out how much oil is left based on the shadows. They could then predict what the oil market would look like before the report has been made about it, and manipulate the market based on the data they collected.</p>

				<p>
					Also, high frequency trading algorithms analyze social media sites to foresee what the market will look like. Although algorithms and data science using databases can’t predict the outlook of the market with a 100% accuracy, it can be used in such ways where an individual can profit from the information collected (mygreatlearning.com).

				<h1>Ethical Issues</h1>
			</div>
				<p>There’s no doubt about machine learning and artificial intelligence leading and developing the world in the near future. As data science is all about machine learning, it has troubles knowing what’s ethically right or wrong. One example of unethical data science is using Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) used by the U.S courts, they were able to evaluate the risk level of a defendant. According to to Maximilian Hofer, a Machine Learning consultor at Sigma Squared, 3 main ethical issues of data science can be unfair discrimination, reinforcing human biases and lack of transparency. </p>
				<h2>1. Unfair Discrimination</h2>
				<p>The data often reflects on unfair social biases on racial discrimination, the Artificial Intelligence learned from the data will also be discriminatingthe race as it reflects on the data given. ProPublica, a news organization, has showed unfair discrimination by analysing over 10,000 defendant samples from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida (towardsdatascience.com). </p>
				<h2>2. Reinforcing Human Biases</h2>
				<p>Data science has limitations making decisions based on previous data, as there could be discrimination against people of a particular race. If the data fed to COMPAS was perfectly unbiased, the discrimination wouldn’t occur. By predicting a certain defendant/race to be high risk, it is obvious that the data being fed is biased against a certain group of people, which is not ethical at all. </p>
				<h2>3. Lack of Transparency</h2>
				<p>Despite the fact that the COMPAS had issues regarding discrimination, the step-by-step process of the workings of COMPAS has not been revealed to the public. Exact function and the processing of the model can be unclear.	</p>
				<h2>More Ethical Issues</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Privacy Issues - methods for handling sensitive data</li>
					<li>Hazards from learning inaccurate or highly biased data from the open internet</li>
				</ul>
